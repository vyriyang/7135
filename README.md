# Stock Forecasting Accuracy with a Prediction Model

## Introduction
This paper explores the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting stock prices. Our study focuses on a decade of U.S. stock market data, spanning from 2010 to 2020. By leveraging LSTM models, which are renowned for their proficiency in handling time-series data, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy and provide a robust tool for strategic investment planning.

## Methodology
Our methodology integrates several key processes:
- **Data Normalization:** To prepare the data for processing.
- **Feature Extraction:** To identify the most relevant information from the dataset.
- **Iterative Model Optimization:** To continuously improve the model's predictions.

## Objectives
The research aims not only to highlight the potential of LSTM networks in capturing complex market dynamics but also to discuss avenues for further enhancement through:
- **More Comprehensive Data Inputs**
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**

## Running the Tests
To run the tests for our model, use the following command:

```bash
python3 7135-LSTMModel.py
